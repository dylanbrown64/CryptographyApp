# Cryptography Web App
## Dylan Brown

The app is set up to run the front end on localhost port 3000.
The backend is set to run on localhost port 8000 using a uvicorn server to run FastAPI

The src file contains all front end work written by me.

The Python Backend folder contains the necessary python code to run the backend. The main.py file is my work, the rest allows python and the necessary packages to work.
